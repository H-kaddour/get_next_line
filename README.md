# Get_next_line
![image](img/gitnextline.jpg)

Hey y'all this project it's all about how to read lines in a `fd`.
The fuction that we allow to use is `read` `malloc` `free`, now if we use read it gonna read the whole file content but we want to read line by line so we have to make three fuctions one for reading the `fd` the second one counts the first line and allocate it and return it and the rest we allocate it in the third function, this are some articles to study the behaviors of get_next_line, don't forget we use `BUFFER_SIZE` to specifie how much `read` function gonna read.
